**Web Development Project**

This is a personal practice project for web development where I try to apply everything I learned in my university web development unit.

**Instructions**

1. Download all the files in to whatever directory you like.

2. Open the directory file with VSCode or whatever you prefer.
  
3. Run 'npm install sqlite3 express'.

4. Run ' node createDB.js' in the terminal, to create the sqlite database file.

5. Run 'node index.js' to run on local host.
