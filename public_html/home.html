                        <p class="card-text">Overloading is a fundamental principle of strength training that involves progressively increasing the intensity or volume of your workouts to continually challenge your muscles and stimulate adaptation. Understanding how to effectively overload your muscles is crucial for making progress and achieving your strength and fitness goals.</p>

While it may seem counterintuitive to back off from intense workouts, deloading plays a crucial role in long-term progress and injury prevention.</p>
